# Cat and Dog Image Classification Challenge
In the Machine Learning with Python curriculum of freeCodeCamp, I created a Cat And Dog Image Classifier model that can distinguish between cats and dogs in mixed images. I applied Image Data Generator to enhance the images by rotating, shifting them horizontally or vertically and flipping them horizontally. To finish it up, I used a mix of Convolutional Neural Networks, Dense Networks & Dropout for the classification task.

Feel free to explore the notebook and have fun learning.
